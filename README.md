Spring Boot (Web, Security, Data JPA)
Spring Security for user authentication
JWT (JSON Web Token) for securing endpoints
H2 Database (for testing) or any relational DB
Lombok (to reduce boilerplate code)
Maven (for dependency management)
JUnit 5 and Mockito (for testing)
System Requirements
Java 17 or higher
Maven (to build the project)
Postman or any API testing tool (for testing APIs)
